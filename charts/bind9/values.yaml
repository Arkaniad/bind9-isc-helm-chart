# To enhance the basic configuration of this chart, you can create a secret

# bind9 resolver configuration
# ATTENTION: This must not contain an `options` block, only zone settings
#            or similar are allowed
#
# Example:
# ```
# apiVersion: v1
# kind: Secret
# metadata:
#   name: my-secret
# stringData:
#   named.conf.options: |
#     zone "my.corporate-domain.example.org" {
