# Helm Chart for bind9

This helm chart is based on the [official ISC docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/internetsystemsconsortium/bind9).

By default, this chart will setup Bind9 as a resolver.

In case you want to forward a zone to your internal nameservers, you can create a secret containing valid named configuration that might look something like this:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-named-configuration-secret
stringData:
  named.conf.local: |
    zone "my.corporate-domain.example.org" {
        type static-stub;
        server-addresses {
                192.168.1.1;
                192.168.1.2;
        };
    };
```

Please pay attention that this can ONLY contain zone settings or similar, no `options` blocks are allowed (as they are already set in the configuration generated by the chart).

You need to provide the name of this secret in the `values.yaml` file like so:

```
[...]
mount_configuration_from_secret:
  secretName: my-named-configuration-secret
[...]
```

After that, install the helm chart like described in the chart's [README](charts/bind9/README.md).
